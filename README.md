5. choose "Record on this computer" in the "... More" menu
6. Play the video
7. After the video, stop the recording and end the meeting
8. zoom processes the video and gives a file
9. Open the file in quicktime player
10. Go to "Edit -> Trim" and trim extra materials from the recording
11. Save the edited file
