Renee C Wurth: ‘We can’t reopen before we are unified’

The battle against Covid-19 has always been one against unknowns. More information is necessary to make good decisions on when and how to open the economy. While we slowly improve our understanding of who has the virus, the goalposts are shifting toward the need to understand who has had the virus. Serology testing tells us who has at least partial immunity, which both improves our ability to gauge how easily the virus will spread and also presents the possibility for governments to certify immunity. Many countries have begun discussing issuing “immunity certificates” as a pathway to returning to work. Yet research on the length of immunity, as well as more viral and serology testing, is needed before proceeding with such a system.

If we do not improve our information, we will have to depend on our ability to work cohesively. Several countries have demonstrated the advantages that come from a unified message and populace. Without ubiquitous testing (which they also have) there is an even greater reliance on the efforts of individuals, mainly isolating if tested positive and efforts to trace contacts. All of these efforts – including phone-based tracing – will require either voluntary compliance or government enforcement. The latter seems unlikely. Without a unified message and approach from our leaders that prioritizes reliable information and national participation, we will be only as strong as our weakest link.

There is a reason most countries are hesitant to reopen. If we do so prematurely we will forfeit the progress we’ve made. We first need more information and to become a more United States.
